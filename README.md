# U3 : Universal Users Union
We believe that users are the the most important component of any platform. However, they do not generally possess a collective voice to discuss what would make the world a better place for them. If we could create a tool for users to collectively raise concerns and take action, we could see changes in their favor.

## What it does
The proof of concept includes a browser extension that can block domains and a smart contract to vote on whether to block a specific domain.

## How we built it
We used solidity to develop the smart contract and standard chrome extension languages to build the extension.

## Challenges we ran into
Learning solidity. There was no single member on our team that had any significant experience with solidity or blockchain development.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
A working smart contract and browser extension.

## What we learned
Blockchain development can be extremely intricate but even more rewarding. The capacity for distributed consensus networks to change the world is essentially limitless from our vantage point.

## What's next for U3
Working with buytwitter.com as a community.

Extending the actionability of the smart contracts beyond simple boycotting of websites to include more sophisticated actions like selective mirroring of sites and selective adblocking. Developing web3 connections to automate actionability more predictably. More rigorous security surrounding smart contracts to ensure that voting mechanisms are difficult to abuse.
